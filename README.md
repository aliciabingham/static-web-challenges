##Description
This repo contains all of the challenges from the static web milestone. Challenges are given as optional extra work after the normal exercises are completed.

I knew that the single page application milestone contained some advanced JavaScript exercises, so I attempted to complete as many challenges as possible, in preparation.

##How To Run
In your terminal, run command ```http-server -p 4040```.

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
